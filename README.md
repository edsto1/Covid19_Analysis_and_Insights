# Covid19 Exploratory Analysis and Deep Learning Predictive Model
An exploratory analysis of the Covid-19 epidemic using recent clinical and demographic data from various academic and medical institutions to gain critical insight and help stop the spread of the virus. We'll use row-level data compiled from the C3.ai API to create an artificial neural network machine learning model, and predict Covid19 patient outcomes using demogrphic and health history data.
